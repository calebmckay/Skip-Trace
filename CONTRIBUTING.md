# How to contribute

contribution is highly encouraged from anyone able to view this repo.
However we ask you keep the following in mind.

## getting started 
### Finding an issue
If you would like to jump in and begin work right away, just find an open issue marked as 'help wanted' and comment on it to request to handle the issue.

### Submitting an idea
All work on modules and src will only be accepted if it is first attached to an issue. If you have an idea for an amazing new feature or bug fix, simply open up a new ticket and an admin will gladly assist in code review or finding someone to help work on it.

## Making changes
First make sure you have been added to an open issue on the topic you are attempting to work on.
Make a topic branch for the issue you are working on in your own fork of the repo.
***** We will not accept any work done on the master branch *****
Avoid merging master, instead use rebase.
When you have completed work on the issue, submit a pull request and an admin will request a code review.

## Documentation
Trivial code comments may be omitted. However if there is moderate to significantly difficult code, comments will be required. Due to the nature of this project, if any code is not easily understood or explained by comments, it will be rejected.
